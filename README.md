## How to use this template :toolbox:

Note: this mini-guide assumes you have `npm` installed on your machine, if you don't, you can download it following the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

1. Click on the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository.
2. Create a new repository based on this template.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
5. You can now start the development server by running `npm run dev` (see this [section](#16-commands-genie_man) for more commands)
6. Now you can start customizing the portfolio template by updating the `/data/info.ts` file with your personal information.

### Notes about the contact section :email:

If you add/remove something from the contact section in the `info.ts` file, you will need to update the `Contact.tsx` file located in the `src/components/contact_section` directory by simply reflecting the changes you made in the `info.ts` file. Although, this choice may seem redundant, it allows to separate the data from the view.

## Commands :genie_man:

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
