## Introduction

### Who Am I?

Hi, I’m **Nick Stambaugh**, a **Business Intelligence and Full Stack Developer** based in **Grand Rapids, MI**. 

My journey into technology and software development stems from a passion for solving complex problems and creating impactful solutions. 

With a formal background in **Economics and Philosophy**, I’ve honed my skills in a wide range of technologies and tools that allow me to develop effective business solutions and applications.

I’m currently pursuing an **MS in Applied Computer Science** with a focus on software engineering at **Grand Valley State University**.

### My Skill Set

Over the years, I’ve gained expertise in both **business intelligence** and **full stack development**. 

I enjoy working on both the front and back end of projects, from creating beautiful user interfaces to handling complex data queries. Here’s a snapshot of my tech stack:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** React.js, Flutter, Laravel, Go, Python, TypeScript, C, SQL.
- **BI Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Zoho Analytics, SQL (for complex queries and data modeling)
- **Development Tools:** Neovim, Docker, Git, Jira, Linux, WSL
- **Specialized Skills:** Database administration (MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server), CRM development (Salesforce/HubSpot/Zoho), and command-line tool development in Go.

> I am particularly passionate about **writing dev tools**, building **interactive dashboards**, and **solving problems using Go**, one of my favorite programming languages.

### My Experience

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in various roles that have shaped my understanding of technology and business. Some of the companies I’ve been part of include:

- **NxGen MDx** as a Sales Operations Analyst, where I deliver powerful dashboards using **Tableau**, **Zoho Analytics**, and **SQL**.
- **National Nail**, where I contributed to business solutions in **BI**, helping transform data into actionable insights.
- **The Right Place, Inc.**, providing data-driven insights that helped guide **economic development** in my region.

My focus is always on creating value through technology—whether it’s through data analysis, web development, or building internal tools that improve workflow efficiency.

### My Hobbies and Projects

When I’m not working or studying, you can often find me developing **personal projects** that push my skills further. 

I’m currently working on a **Connect 4 game in C using Raylib** and a **Non-Profit for donating old devices**.

I also enjoy gaming and am considering a switch to **Linux Mint** for my build, as I find it to be a reliable and customizable OS for both gaming and development.

### Conclusion

Whether it’s building dashboards, writing code, or contributing to open-source projects, I’m always eager to solve problems and improve my craft. 

I’m constantly learning and expanding my skill set, with a long-term goal of mastering complex software in languages like C and Go.
