**CARB** - California Air Resources Board. The regulating body in California that oversees the distribution of allowances for carbon dioxide emissions.

**Cap and Trade** - A system to limit the amount of emissions from a business. The key is that organizations who do not emit can sell their ‘emission credits’ to the businesses who do want to emit, thus incentivizing less emissions since it raises the cost to emit and brings emitting into the open market at a price.

**Capital Costs** - A fixed expense in which land, buildings, construction, machinery is purchased one-time for the purpose of production.

**CCS** - Carbon capture and storage, a large capital-intensive cost that maintains and captures carbon emissions from fossil fuel energy production. Also referred to as CCUS.

**DOE** - Department of Energy, an agency enacted by Congress and the United States government to assist in assessing and implementing energy policy.

**EDF** - Électricité de France, French multinational energy company who mainly focuses on nuclear.

**FOAK** - First of a kind. The first reactors built for any new type of technology.

**IEA** - International Energy Agency, an organization that analyzes global electricity generation and
consumption. It also compares countries’ policies and actions regarding climate change.

**ITC** - Subsidy that is called an Investment Tax Credits which incentivizes investment in new technology by offering tax credit for that specific investment.

**LCOE** - Levelized Cost of Electricity is an economic metric that gauges the cost of investment in a powerplant over the plant’s lifetime generation of electricity. This is frequently used by investors and policymakers to decide if a project is economically viable over the plant’s lifetime.

**LWR AND PWR** - Currently these are the reactor types that are deployed commercially in the United States. They are large, expensive construction projects which take roughly 7-10 years to build. Despite large upfront costs, increasing ROI is expected as the plant takes on upgrades. LWR stands for light water reactor and PWR is a pressurized water reactor and a type of light water reactor.

**NRA** - Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority. Analogous to the U.S.’s NRC.

**NRC** - Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an agency enacted by Congress and the United States government to oversee the licensing and regulation of nuclear power plants.

**Paris Climate Agreement** - This is an international legally binding treaty with 195 signatories which seeks to reduce the harmful effects of CO2 emissions by forcing economic change within countries across the world. Notably, the USA, China, Russia, and the bulk of the EU have signed.

**PTC** - Subsidy that is called a Production Tax Credits which incentivizes production of a certain commodity by offering tax credit for that production.

**PV** - Photovoltaics, the technology that converts sunlight or the sun’s radiation into electricity, widely used within solar panels for the purpose of transferring light/heat from the sun into useable electricity to consumers.

**R&D** - Research and development.

**ROI** - Return on investment, or the rate at which cash is received via investment costs. A ratio that is used by businesses and governments to gauge the economic viability and profitability of a given project.

**SMR** - Small Modular Reactors, small reactors which can be produced in factories for a fraction of the cost and size of current nuclear plants (LWR and PWR). New designs seek to increase safety features and lower construction times, which address the big issue of cost overruns in nuclear power.

**Subsidies** - Governmental incentivization to invest in or expand certain economic sectors. The goal of a subsidy at a fundamental economics level is to increase either supply or demand.

**SWOT** - acronym for Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Used in business to gauge multiple aspects of a company and how the strengths and opportunities can overcome the weaknesses and threats to the organization.

**TCC** - Total Capital Cost. This comprises materials and labor for construction, a decommissioning fund and financing.

## Abstract
Climate change will have a devastating impact on our planet’s ecosystem and its inhabitants. Many changes need to be made across economic sectors with the United States to address this issue. 

It is time for policymakers to take immediate action towards a clean energy future, which is an investment in the health of our citizens and youth. 

Urgency is required for new policies that will change the landscape for
new investments and upgrades to our aging electricity infrastructure across economic sectors.

For energy production in the United States, it is key that we shift our resources and new investments away from fossil fuel sources such as coal and natural gas. By making new and current large-scale nuclear
projects economically viable again in the United States, we can help meet our goals set with the Paris Climate Agreement and lead the world in clean energy production, with the help of other energy sources labeled as renewable or green.
Within our paper, we hope to address some economic concerns with nuclear production for energy usage and to make it clear the path that needs to be taken in order to make commercial nuclear flourish much as it did in the 60s and 70s. Since the major nuclear reactor accidents like Three Mile Island and Fukushima,
public support for nuclear power is not at the levels it should be with respect to having zero carbon-emitting electricity generation, we hope this paper can garnish more support from our local communities for nuclear projects, or any community for that matter. 

The United States desperately needs
a major shift towards a carbon-free power source and right now it is coal production shifting to natural gas production, which is better, but not free of emissions entirely during production like nuclear. By using nuclear as a major energy source, the United States could set itself up for further energy
independence in the future, as nuclear plants can be in production for 70-80 years and that is accomplished with dated technology. We will analyze how the U.S. government must shift its strategy in energy policy via regulations or subsidies, as well as the methods used to guide decision-making, which is
analyzed by comparing the U.S. nuclear market to France’s and Japan’s. For example, in Table 4.5, we see that Japan’s NRA (similar to USA’s NRC) works closely with the construction companies in the nuclear industry and they were able to produce full new nuclear power plants in 4 to 4.5 years. On top of
that, by assessing the policy that can be deployed specifically on nuclear energy production, we can observe how the new policy will influence the capital cost in new construction. Higher carbon prices and ITC/PTC subsidies can make or break nuclear energy as a power source, and will also lay the ground working for how our country tackles climate change. New policy or adjustments to current policy could propel our country towards a clean energy future. This paper will cover what
changes need to be made to the policy with regards to nuclear energy production in the United States.

## Introduction
Figure 1.1
By understanding the fundamentals of how energy production works between these two sources, we can
deepen the baseline knowledge for the general public. Public trust within nuclear energy needs to be
deepened in order for the necessary changes to be made to our overall economy in accordance with the
Paris Climate Agreement. Public support of new nuclear tech which can operate as a separate baseload
technology is vital for nuclear’s growth and sustainment in America. Within the flowchart in Figure 1.1,
we can see a breakdown of how energy is produced via carbon-based organic material on the left and by
nuclear fuel, Uranium & Thorium.
5
On the fossil fuel side, the negative impacts of combustion from biofuels (for example, ethanol or
gasoline in our cars) and fossil fuels have detrimental impacts on human health and the environment. The
negative effects of the combustion of carbon-based substances can be broken into two main categories.
Air pollution includes ash and chemicals such as nitrogen dioxide from energy production. Carbon
dioxide release is separated into its category since the environmental impacts referred to as “climate
change” from this practice have been thoroughly studied across many different academic focuses, with
commonalities being found of the negative impacts from its release into the atmosphere.
On the right, we see the process of energy production from fission which leads to different results than
combustion. A large downside of nuclear which is discussed briefly in this paper is the long-term waste
storage of spent fuel rods. New techniques of fuel storage are being innovated, such as the long-term plan
in Finland which seeks to store spent fuel rods underground for thousands of years with no impact on the
environment (Gil, 2020). Storing waste underground is safe since the waste is stored in highly engineered
caskets under the biosphere, underneath any organic material. The caskets are designed to stop the
movement of radiation for thousands of years (World Nuclear Association, n.d.).
The positives from nuclear energy production largely outweigh this negative since the negative
externalities associated with nuclear energy production are not tied to human and environmental collapse
in the same ways fossil fuels are. Another negative to consider would-be nuclear weapon proliferation. It
is certainly tied to nuclear energy production since investments in nuclear infrastructure for the purpose of
energy can backbone weapons manufacturing. With that being said, the long-term effects of this are
unknown and are hard to examine through the lens of economic analysis since nuclear weapons have only
been deployed twice in warfare (United Nations, n.d.). Despite the positives of production outweighing
the negative externalities to many, this does not stop unnecessary shutdowns due to political reasons from
occurring.
Just recently as this year, the Indian Point nuclear plant in New York was shut down with reports claiming
“Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others who fought for its shutdown argue any benefits from the plant are
eclipsed by the nightmare prospect of a major nuclear accident or a terror strike 25 miles (40 kilometers)
north of the city (Hill, 2021).” These claims by the governor have been echoed throughout nuclear’s
lifetime as a power source in America with the argument always staying the same: of what COULD
happen. The media perpetuates this fear, by using language such as ‘nightmare’. Shutting down a plant
due to the prospect of an accident or terrorist attack implies a city's leadership failed to implement
necessary policies which address these issues or make plans to solve them. Nuclear plants may be a
high-value target for a terrorist attack but that is unlikely to happen since the number of terrorist attacks
has decreased in the United States since the late ’90s and early ’80s (Our World In Data, n.d.). Instead of
attempting to hedge on the uncertain, we should focus on building up our systems which we are certain
can work.
Nuclear plants are forced to invest highly into robust safety features meant to mitigate damages that occur
if such an event were to happen, which have increased significantly following the terrorist attacks of 9/11
(United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, n.d.). More tangible issues that are grounded in reality,
like climate change, can be improved upon by keeping nuclear plants up and running. On top of this,
climate change has been projected out, whereas terrorist attacks are not. This just means that there is no
6
excuse for not fighting climate change, whereas a terrorist attack is more difficult to prepare for, although
still highly important. Many conclusions have been made that nuclear will help combat climate change
and closing existing plants hurts our climate even more (Nuclear Energy Institute, n.d.). Yet the irrational
fear towards an event that may or may not occur leads us to believe there is more behind the decision of
closing Indian Point that has less to do with accidents and more to do with politics.
Overall, the side-by-side comparison of these two flowcharts should provide insight into how different
practices within energy production can lead to vastly divergent outcomes. It highlights how human life, in
general, seeks to gain from electricity production. Despite this, fossil fuel companies causing large-scale
harm in the form of air pollution and climate change, the ulterior motives of those continuing to fund
fossil fuels must be brought into the light, as well as making public the balance sheet of anyone involved
in fossil fuel production, transparency is key to understanding how we can effectively change policy. This
flowchart should make us ask ourselves if wide-spread combustion is worth it for any reason when
alternatives can be created, and clearly points out how nuclear energy can contribute to society in a
positive manner while helping reach the goals set out by the Paris Climate Agreement.
Figure 1.2

Figure 1.3
In general, according to Figure 1.3, the United States’ overall energy generation has been dominated by
coal and natural gas. The total generation using coal surpassed 2,000 billion kilowatt-hours by 2005,
proving the U.S. had a major reliance on coal going into the mid-2000s, with a sharp decline roughly 5
years later, showing a massive change in the U.S. energy mix, as energy sources such as natural gas begin
heavily taking off around the same time.
According to Figure 1.2, the upwards trend of natural gas is explained, as we see that 2020 was a strong
year for natural gas production, holding 44.6% of generation throughout that year. Figure 1.2 also shows
that renewables have just about caught up to nuclear in terms of total generation. This is backed up by the
pie chart in Figure 1.3, as we can see renewables (PV, Solar thermal, on-shore and off-shore wind) shared
+7.7% more of the capacity throughout the year compared to nuclear, meaning the surpassing of total
generation should happen within the next couple years.
While natural gas seeks to replace coal as the dominant power source, renewables and nuclear are not
competing as much as they may seem country-wide, as load capacities across the two tend to have enough
difference that they end up supplying different markets. It is important to note that some renewable farms
like wind and solar are capable of competing with even the largest nuclear plants in terms of load
capacities, like the Bhadla Solar Park in India which boasts an impressive 2245 MW (Institute for Energy
Economics and Financial Analysis, 2020).
Currently, the majority of baseload renewables such as biomass and hydroelectric do not hold enough
market share to compete with nuclear currently. Large scale wind and solar farms like ones that are hastily
8
being put up in China (Xu & Stanway, 2021), who doubled their renewable capacity in 2020, are not
widespread yet but will continue to threaten nuclear energies market share as new projects get taken on.
Despite capacity increasing worldwide for renewable energy, the efficiency of these energy sources is
frequently brought to question. Renewables are dependent on many external factors to produce energy,
mainly wind blowing and the sun shining. This issue of productivity could hinder renewables as a
baseload power source since inconsistencies are out of our control. Nuclear, on the other hand, does not
share this issue.
Planned refuelings, which allow for the proper maintenance and upgrades, are generally the only times in
which a nuclear plant stops supplying. This alone shows why renewables cannot fight alone against fossil
fuels and natural gas to produce clean energy. A sufficient, large-scale production must be able to provide
baseload power to consumers when renewables might not be able to. As stated earlier, natural gas is
clearly taking a foothold as a baseload power supplier, since natural gas plants can produce upwards of
50-60% less CO2 than coal plants (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2014). This is directly lowering
nuclear’s market share.
However, emissions from natural gas compared to nuclear power paint a much different story. Nuclear
energy produces roughly 7% of the CO2 emissions that natural gas does and only 3% for coal (World
Nuclear Association, n.d.). This means that natural gas produces 15 times more CO2 than nuclear and
about 30 times more than coal. This shows that natural gas is clearly not effective enough at reducing
carbon emissions and should be seen as a band-aid for a gaping wound. Nuclear and renewables are a
more proper remedy for a society seeking carbon neutrality.
Why New Policy in Energy Production is Desired
It is proven that climate change is becoming increasingly threatening and expensive to our planet on a
global scale. This is being caused by the burning of fossil fuels, whether it be from energy production,
transportation, etc. which will continue to have downstream impacts on human health, the environment,
and the global economy (Nunn et al., 2019). By changing the policy within high emitting economic
sectors, we can prepare communities for the change over to reliance on clean energy and incentivize
investments into different technologies such as nuclear energy.
Greenhouse gas emissions are the main focus of the Paris Climate Agreement since the emissions experts
are calling attention to raise the temperature of the earth’s surface since the carbon dioxide is trapped in
our atmosphere (NASA, n.d.). On the chart below, you can see a breakdown of emissions across U.S.
economic sectors, with electricity generation taking a fourth of the chart up.
9
Figure 1.4
Currently, because of these emissions, the sea level increases by 3.4 mm a year, and that number is rising
(NASA, 2021). This could lead to large-scale displacement of populations near certain large bodies of
water. Effects on precipitation patterns, as well as frost-free seasons, will directly hurt our farmers who
vitally produce for the food supply chain here in the U.S. and are estimated to have generated 1.109
Trillion USD for our GDP in 2019 including related industries that farmers support (United States
Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, n.d.). On top of more droughts and famines due
to this, hurricanes will become more deadly and frequent (Knutson, 2021). These issues with the
environment are horrendous enough but do not paint the entire picture of how devastating climate change
will be to humans.
The effects of climate change don't just affect the environment, they will directly hurt the overall human
health of the world. According to CDC.gov, “Ground-level ozone (a key component of smog) is
associated with many health problems, such as diminished lung function, increased hospital admissions
and emergency room visits for asthma, and increases in premature deaths” (Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2020). Climate change could clearly hurt the average person’s pocket book since the
typical hospital room stay costs around $10k and more pollution increases the average person’s chances of
visiting the hospital (Fay, 2021). The Paris Climate Agreement sought to answer a lot of these problems
since accountability can now be held against a government or private business if you fail to prepare and
adjust your economy to match the changes that need to be made.
The growing need for policy advocating for clean energy production could lead to breakthroughs in the
area of transportation and others. With that in mind, we see how clean electricity is capable of having
downstream impacts on the other sectors. These effects won't be analyzed, rather it is important to point
10
out that clean energy production can lead to further technological developments in other areas outside of
energy production. Electric vehicles, electric home heating, etc. will then, almost, be entirely free of
carbon emissions. Thus, decarbonizing the electricity sector through policy change is of major importance
in our fastest path to zero and meeting the benchmark set out by the Paris Climate Agreement of limiting
the global temperature increase to 1.5℃ to 2℃ above pre-industrial levels in this century (Denchak,
2021). To achieve this, the member countries are aiming to become net carbon emission neutral by 2050
(United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 2015).
Meeting the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by limiting the rise in the average global
temperature for the 21st century will take many different methods. The main metric for achieving the
slowing rise in average temperature is reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the top emitting
economies. A key emitting industry is the electricity generating industry. With clean, carbon-neutral ways
of producing electricity for consumption, there will be many downstream effects like the utilization of
electric vehicles and heating of buildings that could be powered by a green energy source instead of fossil
fuels. Currently, the common types of green energy sources in this conversation are wind turbines and
solar PV panels. However, nuclear should also be a serious part of this discussion because it does have
strengths that can supplement renewable energy. These two, nuclear energy and renewable energy, can
work together to help us get to our carbon goals and climate goals steadily and on time.
At this time, nuclear energy has substantially higher capital costs than other methods of electricity
production. We will be examining how it currently compares to coal, natural gas, wind turbines, and solar
PVs. Then, we look at two major ways to make nuclear energy cost-competitive in new construction, by
increasing the price of carbon and by tax credits.
Methodology
Comparing the costs of building new power plants of each type will be done by looking at total capital
cost (TCC) and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We will be using the International Energy
Agency’s (IEA) formula for calculating LCOE (International Energy Agency, 2020). Since we are mainly
interested in making nuclear cost-competitive based on its construction cost, we will look at its TCC
where construction cost is the major component of TCC. LCOE will be compared for the purpose of
examining the impact of carbon prices on fossil fuel-based energy production.

Analysis
SWOT Analysis
To start off our analysis, we will look at our SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)
analysis of large nuclear plants in the United States. We can see some insight into different aspects of
nuclear energy. The SWOT analysis is frequently done in businesses of all sizes to gauge the company or
the market in terms of its strengths and weaknesses and how those can be used to overcome the
opportunities and threats that face the firm.
12
Figure 3.1
By understanding the positives and downsides of nuclear through this lens, applying the correct policy
becomes easier if the weaknesses and threats can be identified. Changes in policy within some of these
areas have already been identified and pushed for, such as our uranium supply and weapon proliferation
(Baranwal, 2020; Ferguson, 2009). With that in mind, the threat section of the SWOT gets to the bulk of
the issues surrounding nuclear and showcases what policies are highly desired in nuclear: safety and cost.
Alternative energy sources, mainly natural gas and renewables, are great threats to nuclear energy since
they’re projected to cost less in the foreseeable future (United States Energy Information Agency, 2021).
For nuclear to succeed in the current energy market within the United States, the threats of long-term
nuclear waste storage, safety, and the loss of market share to renewables/natural gas must be addressed.
While our claims of a lower-cost nuclear market are possible, leaving too much room for firms to cut
corners must be highly considered in regulatory practices of energy production. With the new plant and
reactor designs consistently being innovated, nuclear plants of the future must address these issues in a
way that saves money in the long run in a safe manner. Also, the state must regulate efficiently in order to
keep firms operating properly and help keep costs low by using streamlined systems to monitor and gauge
plants on an individual basis. Top entrepreneurs have had this same idea for a long time now.
From a non-policy standpoint, Elon Musk, who has made large innovations towards clean energy in the
transportation industry, recently claimed, “I really think it’s possible to make very, extremely safe nuclear
(Clifford, 2021).” For nuclear energy to make any significant comeback, entrepreneurs like Musk must
step up and lead the charge through innovation or the proper backing of the people who can help innovate.
While innovations are happening rapidly across all energy sources, nuclear energy specifically could
garnish large results if more tech-driven, unconventional businesses like the ones founded by Musk thrust
13
new ideas into the aging industry of large-scale nuclear production. With America’s finest business talent
leading the charge, nuclear energy could have a large comeback if the threats listed in this analysis are
addressed swiftly.
Age of Current Plants
Figure 3.2
Data taken from https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=US
As shown in Figure 3.2, the variable represented on the X-axis as AGE is from the first year construction
began on the plant, the average nuclear plant since construction began is reaching past the age of 50
already, with the mean age being 50.5 years. For reference, 43 years before 2021 was 1978, 53 years ago
was 1968, and 65 years ago was 1956. Looking at a plant from the age it began construction is relevant
since liabilities towards the owners begin to occur despite no production of energy taking place yet. With
this in mind, the government and industry need to begin preparing plants for reinvestments and lifetime
extensions or to be slated for decommissioning.
In the United States, licensing is given for 40 years although most plants have already renewed their
license for the standard 60 years, which is why it is time to begin preparation for these plant’s futures.
14
Plants must pass rigorous examinations from the NRC, which include full inspections, environmental
impact reviews, analysis of aging effects, and overall performance evaluations (Nuclear Energy Institute,
n.d.). To back this claim, energy.gov reports, “To date, 20 reactors, representing more than a fifth of the
nation’s fleet, are planning or intending to operate up to 80 years (United States Department of Energy,
2021).” The lifetime extensions these plants are receiving could prove to be beneficial to investors
looking to hold assets long term. Closing down a nuclear plant prematurely or altogether could lead to
more harmful effects on the environment and it could stop the stakeholder’s chances of profiting or
maximizing current profits (Clemmer et al., 2018).
As a plant continues to get upgraded over time, the cost is significantly lower compared to initial capital
investment, so it can be expected that its output and thus revenue increases. This is a massive strength
towards nuclear’s case for increasing its share within the energy mix. Nuclear energy is proven as a
long-term reliable energy option that can be deployed for large-scale projects (World Nuclear Association,
n.d.).
On the flip side, when a nuclear plant does decide to shut down and go into the decommissioning phase of
the life-cycle, the plant has likely already been online for 50+ years. Decommissioning due to aging has a
relatively small impact on the total overall cost of a plant compared to the overall budget of a plant. Some
estimates range the total cost of decommissioning making up 9-15% of the initial capital cost of a nuclear
plant (World Nuclear Association, 2020).
Regulations
Nuclear regulations following the Three Mile Island accident affected the construction of new plants
starting in 1980 with the NRC Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1980 and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
1980 (Holt, 2015). This led to an increase in construction time as new guidelines for structures on sites
were increased which required additional layers of safety and protection to be put into place (Cohen,
1990). More time was spent in the planning phases as designs had to be altered by planning professionals.
Bernard L Cohen states, “according to the United Engineers estimates, the time from project initiation to
groundbreaking was 16 months in 1967, 32 months in 1972, and 54 months in 1980.” Along with
increases in inflation, pre-production planning during the 1980s greatly increased the cost of labor during
the construction of new nuclear plants. Table 3.3 is a breakdown of how the NRC structures the regulatory
practices of the agency and the effects they have on the governed bodies.

For the state to regulate effectively, the policy that is put forward for nuclear must be flexible yet
thorough in its design. The accident that occurred at Three Mile Island, a crisis in which the release of
radioactivity “did not seriously contaminate the surrounding area with radioactive isotopes (University of
California Press, n.d.).” This led the way for a policy that is counterintuitive towards the production of
energy using nuclear power. Other forms of policy have also come into fruition in recent years.
There are a few new policies put into effect within the past couple of years and a few in the making are
currently being discussed. They are ONWARDS and a new infrastructure plan that was passed by the US
Senate and is being voted on in the US House of Representatives at the time of writing. ONWARDS
stands for Optimizing Nuclear Waste and Advanced Reactor Disposal systems. It provides $40 million of
funding towards research in advanced nuclear reactors and reducing the spent fuel waste. The
ONWARDS program is a part of ARPA-E, the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy branch of
the US Department of Energy. The infrastructure bill that was recently passed by the Senate has some
sections providing funding for nuclear research and operations. They are found in Sec. 40321-40323 and
Sec. 41002. Funding for nuclear research includes research into micro and small modular nuclear reactors
and advanced nuclear reactor demonstrations or test runs. There are funds made available, $6 billion
according to Catherine Morehouse for Utility Dive, for nuclear plants that might cease operations due to
economic hardship and will be awarded funds over a 4 year period (Morehouse, 2021).
16
New plants or projects that may come from renewed interest in nuclear energy could benefit greatly from
more lenient regulations. While safety is one of the utmost priorities for any business, regulations from
the NRC are expensive and bog down the production process. The process in the United States to obtain a
license is not difficult but can take time and cost a lot, which leads to the overruns that increase the LCOE
value of a plant.
Construction Time of New Nuclear Plants
Figure 3.4
In Figure 3.4, we notice that there is already a steady increase in TCC prior to the Three Mile Incident in
6. Looking at the data from the EIA and decommissioningcollaborative.org, we obtained a rough
TCC that likely includes initial capital cost for the construction and refurbishment over the years to
improve and maintain plant operation. The data pulled is for a one reactor plant and some of the years had
multiple plants begin construction which we averaged the TCC and the years from construction start to
grid connection. Grid connection is taken to mean that the plant has begun commercial operation.
In Figure 3.5, it shows that with each new construction there is an increase in rated output. Like in Figure
3.4, for years that had multiple plants begin construction, the rated output was averaged. The increase in
rated output is likely from changes and improvements in reactor technology which should coincide with
17
the increase in price and time to commercial operation. These reactors are likely first-of-a-kind (FOAK)
and would also contribute to the dramatic increase in TCC. The designers and engineers have to begin the
process of learning which new practices to adopt for the new technology being implemented when
working with FOAK. However, in subsequent builds, the learning obtained from FOAK should translate
to a reduction in materials and time needed for construction. Instead, we see that the time from
construction start to grid connection also overlaps with the Three Mile Island reactor no. 2 meltdown.
Looking over the entries on PRIS and the EIA, we have not seen any new nuclear plant constructions after
the Three Mile Island.
Figure 3.5
Construction time of nuclear power plants was relatively quick in the 1960s when the first plants were
being built. Over time, with more sophisticated reactors and equipment being used, the overall
construction time slowly increased. This became more pronounced after the Three Mile Island accident.
The backlash against the nuclear industry was fierce and the federal government needed to enact policies
to safeguard against any problems that may arise during the operation of a nuclear plant in the future.
Because of the increase in the number of safety measures that were being implemented by Congress and
to be enforced by the NRC, it forced nuclear plant owners to reevaluate the plant designs to accommodate
these new safety features. Doing so, increased the amount of time required for the construction of new
18
plants and reactors greatly as shown in Figure 3.4. With the increase in construction time, the costs of
professional labor like engineers and management also increased.
From an MIT report, Department of Energy (DOE) researchers discovered that construction costs of
plants increased mostly from indirect costs - costs that are related to engineering and designing, on-site
supervision, and facilities needed during the building process (Stauffer, 2020). These indirect costs total
about 72% of increases in cost from 1976-1987 while the remainder was mostly attributed to three
physical components: the steam supply system, the turbine generator, and the containment building.
The DOE researchers discovered that based on cost estimations for the construction of containment
buildings, they were able to discern that most of the cost increases were based on more materials being
used and a drop in labor productivity. Labor productivity in the construction industry had dropped overall
from 1976-2017 but construction in the nuclear energy industry, in particular, had lowered an ever greater
amount. The DOE also discovered there was a discrepancy between projections and actual material usage
that contributed significantly to the cost overruns. Large, capital intensive projects suffer hard when labor
productivity drops, which highlights why policy changes within massive capital projects need to be
considered.
Capital Costs
Capital costs consist of raw materials and labor needed for new plant construction, land procurement,
operator license, decommissioning fund, and financing/interest rate on loans for the project. Within
nuclear energy from a global standpoint, capital costs are the most intensive and most likely to cause
overrun. This means that tightly controlled markets will benefit from putting up nuclear plants since
funding and construction are streamlined.

Figure 3.7
Table 3.6 is the numerical representation of data on total capital costs of different plant types in USD from
a 2020 report for the EIA by Sargent & Lundy as well as the rated output in MW for each plant type.
Figure 3.7 is a graphical representation that gives us a better look at how the costs compare with each
other. The EIA report did not have a look at nuclear long-term operation plants, which are plants that are
upgraded and run beyond their original lifecycles, so it was not included. What is included is coal
without and with a carbon capture system installed, natural gas with and without a carbon capture system
(CCS), advanced nuclear light water reactor, nuclear small modular reactor system, offshore and onshore
wind, solar PV panels, and solar PV with a battery storage solution. These are all electricity generation
facilities that are considered utility-scale. This means that they are to be operated by a utility company
and sell their electricity produced on the market, as opposed to selling at a wholesale price to a utility
company to transfer the electricity.
The data gathered from the EIA shows a nuclear LWR is significantly more costly in total capital costs for
new construction in comparison with all other types of electricity generation. However, when we look at
Figure 3.8, the USD/kW of nuclear LWR is much closer to offshore wind and coal with a 90% CCS.
Also, the expected plant operating lifetimes differ with nuclear LWR needing minor investments in
upkeep and license extensions to continue running for more years.
From an economic point of view, the real reason nuclear is not more widespread is because of its price
tag. Using the above table and graph with data from the EIA shows the striking difference in total capital
costs to build a new LWR nuclear power plant. Investors could be put off by issues with nuclear waste
21
and radiation, as for financial purposes they care more about return on investment (ROI), and currently
nuclear is one of the most expensive energy sources around. Additionally, the majority of nuclear plants in
the US are approaching the end of their lifetimes.
Investment in new large-scale nuclear plants is dropping because of its initial price. So instead of building
new nuclear plants, cheaper alternatives are chosen, either natural gas plants or renewable energy plants.
Natural gas is chosen over coal because the price of natural gas is currently low and it doesn’t emit as
many harmful pollutants as coal (United States Energy Information Agency, 2021). However, renewables
are not yet able to sustain energy output to cover base load demands, so ultimately, natural gas plants will
be chosen to be built. Therefore, in order for nuclear power to become more widespread as a means of
producing electricity that does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, it must become more economically
competitive with its base load competitors, coal and natural gas.
Figure 3.8
Figure 3.8: EIA notes that for Total Overnight Costs:” Overnight capital cost includes contingency factors and excludes regional multipliers
(except as noted for wind and solar PV) and learning effects. Interest charges are also excluded. The capital costs represent current costs for plants
that would come online in 2021.
The total overnight cost for wind and solar PV technologies in the table is the average input value across all 25 electricity market regions, as
weighted by the respective capacity of that type installed during 2019 in each region to account for the substantial regional variation in wind and
solar costs. The input value used for onshore wind in AEO2021 was $1,268 per kilowatt (kW), and for solar PV with tracking it was $1,232/kW,
which represents the cost of building a plant excluding regional factors. Region-specific factors contributing to the substantial regional variation
in cost include differences in typical project size across regions, accessibility of resources, and variation in labor and other construction costs
throughout the country.”
According to Figure 3.8, the data are projections done by the EIA to estimate what the overnight cost of a
power plant could be based on the source. We see that overnight costs in terms of $/kW are higher in
22
nuclear (LWR, SMR) compared to other energy technologies. This table is one of the main reasons
nuclear is not being considered as a long-term viable option to support our growing energy grid since the
cost of construction is simply too high. We see how production can impact projected $/kW. Despite LWR
technology being some of the most expensive in construction costs alone, it is unmatched in terms of what
is capable with size and output. It is important to compare costs in terms of output as well. The
opportunity cost of an energy project is dependent on the amount of output you are expecting, therefore
some projects might require a nuclear LWR since it can provide baseload power. We will now discuss
why that is important within the next section.
Comparing LCOE of different plant types
Using the IEA’s online LCOE calculator, we will be looking at the different power plant types in the
following graphs. By making adjustments to the carbon price in Figures 3.10-3.12, we notice that changes
in carbon price do not affect the LCOE of nuclear and renewable energy types. It makes sense because
they do not emit CO2 while operating. For fossil fuel plants, the plants that have carbon capture and
sequestration systems (CCUS) are not as affected by the changes in carbon price as fossil fuel plants that
do not have the CCUS.
Nuclear plants are designed to have an operating lifespan of 40 years. LTO, long-term operation, is
beyond that. In the U.S. 20-year extensions to operating licenses are given out when operators of plants
have applied for them and passed the necessary checks (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
2020). But, what is shown in the graphs made from data taken from the IEA, are a category for LTO with
a 10-year duration and LTO with a 20-year duration. There would be additional capital costs with LTO
because parts would need to be replaced and upgraded for the continued functioning of the plant beyond
the original lifespan and specifications. The extra capital costs would be much smaller compared to a
new build because most of the existing structures and parts would not need to be replaced.
Table 3.9
Carbon price Reasoning
$0 Chosen to observe the effects of a lax approach to carbon emissions
$30 IEA’s default price they observed globally
$50 Roughly the price set by Biden Administration
$100 Chosen to observe the effects of a more aggressive approach to carbon emissions
In Table 3.9, we offer some explanations on the carbon prices chosen that are represented in Figures
3.10-3.12. A low carbon price of $0-30 is beneficial or advantageous to fossil fuel power plants that don’t
have a CCS in regards to how it affects the LCOE of new plant construction. In comparison to a new
nuclear LWR construction, Gas CCGT without CCS and low carbon price is more cost competitive at a
3% discount rate. It takes a $50 or more carbon price and a discount rate of 3% before nuclear LWR
becomes more cost competitive than Gas without CCS. Gas with CCS becomes cost competitive with
23
nuclear LWR when discount rates are 7% or higher. Also, if the US chooses to pursue an aggressive
approach to tackling its climate goals, it would set carbon prices higher. This would incentivize fossil fuel
burning plants’ owners to invest in CCS. If potential investors in power generating plants have to choose
between a natural gas plant with a CCS or between a nuclear LWR plant, they may find a nuclear LWR
more appealing in this situation.
In the IEA report on discount rates, ”...a 3% discount rate corresponds approximately to the social cost of
capital, a 7% discount rate corresponds approximately to the capital cost of a large utility in a deregulated
or restructured market, and a 10% discount rate corresponds approximately to the cost of capital in an
environment with relatively higher risks (International Energy Agency, 2020).” They go on to say that,
“Nominal discount rates would be higher, reflecting inflation.” It’s also mentioned that there would likely
be differences in discount rates between different plant types. This is likely due to the perceived risk
involved in building a new power plant of any given type and how long the construction process is which
leads to how soon the plant begins operation. The sooner the plant is able to begin operating, the sooner it
can generate revenue.
New nuclear light water reactor (LWR) plant constructions are cost-competitive when the discount rate is
low and the carbon price is high as shown in Figure 3.10. But, when discount rates are high, at 10% in
Figure 3.12, nuclear LWR is no longer competitive with its current alternatives, such as natural gas with a
CCUS, solar PV, and wind. As explained previously, the discount rates won’t be the same between
different plant types. This can be attributed to a variety of reasons that consider the lender’s stance on a
particular energy type, the lender’s stance on global climate policy, which forecasting model the investor
aligns with regarding the revenue schedule and ROI of a particular energy type, energy market trends, and
availability of government funding among many other reasons.

Cap and Trade
Not many regions in the US have a cap and trade system for carbon emissions. California is currently the
only individual state with a fully functioning system and Washington state has one in development. The
RGGI (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) is an agreement between 11 states, as of January 2021, in the
northeastern part of the US (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia) with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 30% of 2020 levels by the year 2030 (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, n.d.).
This market approach is considered better for dealing with CO2 emissions because it is more flexible for
firms by rewarding good behavior. Firms that are emitting below their allowances can sell their excess
allowances to firms that are emitting more than the number of allowances they currently own. In
California’s case, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) gives out a certain number of free
allowances to firms and has set the auction price of additional allowances to about $19 as of May 2021
and as shown in Table 3.15 (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, n.d.). One allowance is equal to
one metric ton of carbon equivalent emissions. Currently, CARB has a self-ratcheting system where a set
amount of allowances are auctioned off in a given period and the ones that remain unsold for a certain
period are taken off the market. CARB is also allowing additional allowances to be available for trade
beyond the initial allotment set at the current going price at a higher price (California Air Resources
Board, n.d.).
27
Revenue generated from this program allows California to invest in more green projects. These projects
include further research for green energy types, promotion of low and no carbon-emitting forms of
transportation, and sustainable agriculture. California has taken some of the externalized costs of energy
generation and industry and reinvested it in various ways to help benefit the citizens of the state.
Having a low floor on a carbon price of $19 does not make nuclear as attractive of an option going by the
data pulled from the IEA calculator graphed in the section discussing LCOE. This carbon price would put
fossil fuel plants at slightly below the $30 mark in Figures 3.10-3.12. Nuclear power plants do take a
considerable amount of time to construct and would only become more cost-competitive if plants
continue to operate beyond their originally scheduled lifetimes as shown in the difference between
Nuclear LWR and Nuclear LTO.
Table 3.13

Figure 3.14
Carbon Capture and Storage System
One way for fossil fuel plants to help internalize the costs of the burden on the society they produce
would be through a carbon capture system. A carbon capture system is built onto existing plants or
built-in during new plant construction. Carbon capture systems can raise a plant LCOE value quite
drastically but we feel as if this will be the best way for coal and/or natural gas plants to begin
manifesting the negative externalities placed onto society, this is backed by our graphics since fossil fuel
plants with carbon capture and storage are less impacted by increased carbon prices. The question at hand
remains simple: will we accept increased rates of medical bills, disease, and death from pollution with
regards to coal and fossil fuel production? Or will we say that enough is enough, and force fossil fuel
firms to pay for the economic damages they cause in a wide variety of areas? Not only will a carbon
capture system help with this but it will also reduce the amount of new CO2 into the atmosphere.
Carbon capture would be mostly for coal because of the number of emissions per kWh produced from
burning coal. This won’t always be the case though, as seen earlier in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, natural gas is
taking a stronghold in the United States as the key supplier of energy and the pandemic seemed to solidify
that natural gas is becoming increasingly engrossing to key energy investors economically due to its low
cost for capital, fewer emissions compared to other fossil fuel sources and abundance of fuel. Specifically,
in the United States, natural gas production is largely spurred on by federal government incentives such as
29
tax credits and subsidization. To coincide with green energy sources, natural gas producers must be
willing to internalize their harmful costs on society with carbon capture. This will spur debate since a
large perk to natural gas in its current state is the low barrier of entry compared to other energy sources.
Overall, a policy requiring a carbon capture system can internalize some of the costs/damages that have
already been done to society to the firms that caused it and possibly drive investors towards other energy
sources such as nuclear. We believe the fastest path to zero must involve carbon capture technology since
it could rapidly reduce the number of emissions per year while opening the doors for further development
of clean energy sources. On top of this, a carbon capture and storage system will allow for nuclear to
become more cost-competitive since capital-intensive projects tend to incur much larger costs.
Financing New Nuclear Construction Projects
Starting up and financing a new nuclear plant can be difficult for a number of reasons. High capital costs
and government vetting processes at the beginning of a plant’s life cycle can feel like lighting money on
fire for investors, since the bulk of the cost will be upfront, and revenue is not expected until production
comes online. In the United States, the responsibility of securing the correct investment for the job falls
solely on the plant’s operating parties, which may be more than one company to spread liability. By
spreading the risk of the financing between multiple parties an operating company may feel more
comfortable with their investment since profit and losses will be shared.
The nuclear market is difficult to break into within the United States since the government will only allow
certain companies to build new plants. Companies must show a track record of being safe and efficient, as
well as having a clear working plan for waste and decommissioning before any bank or government will
allow a plant to go up. As of right now, new nuclear construction projects are not financially viable since
the construction process of a plant takes far too long and costs too much. The federal government can
solve both of these issues by honing in and adjusting the regulatory practices or bodies that govern
nuclear plants to more accurately reflect the current global nuclear market.
As of right now, the United States is falling behind other superpowers because of this, notably China. A
more centralized government allows for more effective and reliable financing compared to an open
market. France, which is discussed in depth later, is a great example of how a liberalized democracy can
centralize the energy economy for the sake of efficiency, making financing and any large-scale
infrastructure project easier. This claim is backed by the fact that France builds PWRs faster than the
world average (Carajilescov & Moreira, 2011).
While the open market seeks to lower monetary prices using competition, economic analysis of energy
production highlights how the social cost of carbon outweighs the gains that the open market seeks. This
is a fundamental flaw within the philosophy of American energy production. Politics, unfortunately,
outweigh economics at the end of the day and the American political system believes in maximizing
stockholder shares, including energy businesses, which gets inhibited when you mention the social cost of
carbon emissions.
30
Decommissioning
Decommissioning is the process of deciding what should be done with a power generation station at the
end of its operating life. Normally, plant owners are required to set aside funds for the plant’s eventual
decommissioning. For nuclear plants, the amount is relatively small compared to the construction costs
portion of total capital costs. From the IEA’s 2020 LCOE calculations dataset, this ranges from
$0.39/MWh for a 1100MW nuclear LWR with 3% discount rate to to $0.01/MWh for the same output
plant with a 10% discount rate (International Energy Agency, 2020). Compared to the construction costs
of $22.58/MWh for a 3% discount rate and $77.61/MWh for a 10% discount rate.
Plant decommissioning can take on many forms. What laypeople may think of decommissioning is the
plant site will be completely disassembled and the land restored to how it was before the plant was
constructed. However, there are actually many different kinds and levels of decommissioning. In the
report on the decommissioning of power plants, other than nuclear, in the US from the Resources for the
Future (RFF), this is made much clearer (Raimi, 2017).
Figure 3.15
Source: Resources for the Future (2017)
According to Figure 3.15, only the third branch under “Decommission” fulfills what a layperson would
normally consider decommissioning. This is when all waste products have to be removed from the plant
site and all evidence of the previously existing power plant has to be removed. The land has to be
rehabilitated and free from any contaminants that may have been released from the power plant into the
31
surrounding environment. Once all of this work is done, and it is supposed to be the responsibility of the
owner of the power plant, the land and environment is inspected to ensure it will be suitable for spaces
where people can build homes.
But, the complete decommissioning of a plant is not always economically viable for owners, so the land is
not converted back into the “greenfield” or back to pre-plant conditions. For nuclear plants, being built a
ways outside of metro areas, this can mean land that used to be classified as wilderness. More often, the
land will be repurposed to a state where the land is remediated well enough that it can be repurposed for
industrial use. This state is called a “brownfield,” from Figure 3.15.
The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that nuclear plant sites being decommissioned
have their license terminated and for the land to either be released for unrestricted use or to be released for
restricted use (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2021). What the NRC calls “unrestricted
use” would be similar to “greenfield” from the RFF. The plant site can have a portion of the space housing
the dry cask storage of spent fuel and reactor parts that have to be maintained by the plant owner. The
rest of the site is available for anyone to use or develop in the “unrestricted use” scenario.
An example of a plant decommissioning that falls under “unrestricted use” is the Connecticut Yankee
nuclear power plant at Haddam Neck, Connecticut (Connecticut Yankee, n.d.). They were able to remove
as much of the existing plant structure as possible except for the spent fuel and high-level radioactive
reactor parts that are stored in large cement dry casks. This is probably one of the best examples of
decommissioning a nuclear power plant to revert the land back to pre-nuclear plant use as there is with
regards to what the owner of the plant is able to accomplish.
Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, the investor group that owns the plant, removed all of the
buildings and infrastructure as required by NRC guidelines. This consists of containment buildings,
offices, parking lots, pumps, and pipes, etc. The dry casks of spent fuel and reactor parts are still on site
and have to be monitored by Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company because they claim that the
DOE has not retrieved them as outlined in their agreement. Around 38 acres of land has been turned over
to the US Fish and Wildlife Service along the Salmon River to be used as a wildlife refuge.
Subsidies & Investments
To start off, we would like to discuss some comparisons amongst different subsidy types. Subsidies can
take on many different forms, often being split into direct, indirect, and R&D subsidies. For energy
production, there are mainly direct and R&D subsidies that can take on the form of many different
schemes, with the goal being to make technology more competitive and to adjust the price and cost of the
commodity. As you can see below in Figure 3.16, this is a basic breakdown of the subsidies nuclear has
received from 1950 to 2016. Since nuclear is heavily dependent on the technology it works off of, R&D
has been substantially invested towards it. The thorough safety designs, fail-safe features, employee
training, and a lot more has been directly impacted due to the massive amounts of research put towards
large-scale reactors, the industry owes these subsidies a lot for the growth and sustainability of the
market.
32
Figure 3.16
With that being said, the subsidies are not enough. Nuclear energy has received 8% of all federal
incentives from 1950-2016, compared to oil's 40% and renewables’ 16%, which totals roughly a billion
dollars or 80 million for just nuclear at 8% (World Nuclear Association, 2018). According to the
Environment and Energy Study Institute, direct subsidies aimed towards fossil fuels result in $20 Billion
per year with a breakdown of roughly 20% for coal and the other 80% for crude oil and natural gas
(Coleman & Dietz, 2019). This showcases how the citizens of the United States, who largely fund these
subsidies, need to make their voices heard if any significant change is going to happen.
With the ushering in of the Biden Administration, new or increasing subsidies towards fossil fuels are
unlikely in the future but that does not change how the current tax code in the United States is laid out,
which seeks to directly benefit the fossil fuel industry in its current state. Just as recently as 2017,
President Trump’s tax plan upheld 26 U.S. Code § 263, related to intangible drilling deductions, states
that: “...which granted the option to deduct as expenses intangible drilling and development costs in the
case of oil and gas wells and which were recognized and approved by the Congress (Govinfo, 2012)”.
These parts of the U.S. tax code have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying to keep up, which
directly benefits those involved in fossil fuel production (OpenSecrets.org, 2021).
On top of that, a massive tool used by governments to subsidize the production of commodities is the
PTC or Production Tax Credit. This form of subsidy helps with new plants implementing state-of-the-art
technology since it can raise some of the risk, as well as older plants since production numbers have likely
stabilized and will be expected to grow alongside the reactor upgrades. An investor who can forecast costs
33
with a long-term PTC in mind will feel more comfortable with the construction of a plant since the
growth and upgrading of the plant could mean more money saved per MWh of electricity produced. This
could also potentially help with large plants since the production numbers of nuclear plants are high in
volume and efficient compared to other energy sources (United States Department of Energy, 2021).
As of 2021, the current political climate around PTC in the US is shifting, with Democrat lawmakers
being recently pressured by the industry to implement a PTC (PTC Letter of Support, 2021). Currently, in
the United States, nuclear plants receive “1.8 c/kWh from the first 6000 MWe of new-generation nuclear
plants in the first eight years of operation (World Nuclear Association, 2020).” This small credit for the
first 6000 MWe simply is not enough to make nuclear competitive with other energy sources. The first
problem is that nuclear’s costs mainly come from construction and capital costs, which cause a high
LCOE value. The production of nuclear energy can be unprofitable in the beginning, which is what this
credit addresses, but overall it misses the mark on being influential towards lowering the LCOE, which
will be an incentive to investors to build more nuclear plants, which is where a bulk of the risk lies.
Secondly, an investment tax credit (ITC) could also be useful towards upgrades and new plants. An
investment tax credit is exactly what it sounds like, a credit for investing within a certain technology. This
type of policy has been proposed for nuclear plants in the past in the House and is considered being used
to help the energy market as a whole with regards to the distribution of energy (Galford, 2019; Ernst &
Young, 2021). By giving an ITC to nuclear energy and supporting industries like utility companies, the
government could allow existing plants to upgrade to the sufficient parts that they need and incentivize
new investments towards nuclear construction. This addresses our issue with PTC, as well as increasing
the number of jobs provided to the economy if new construction or upgrades were to begin. PTCs would
not be applicable to new plants in construction because they are a credit given based on the amount of
electricity generated. Also, new nuclear plants take many years to be built, with the average plant between
1976-2009 was roughly 7.7 years (Carajilescov, Moreira, 2011).
Technology & Government Involvement
Some technologies that may be subsidized by an ITC are SMRs or Small Modular Reactors, which can be
produced in factories and deployed on a smaller scale than traditional nuclear reactors with more safety
features. This allows for full containment and analysis of the systems individually, which are then created
with the whole project in mind. The economies of scale found in large reactors are traded off in SMRs for
quick deployment times and hopefully, faster learning rates, which are gauged by capital cost per MW
installed and have been a long-time issue for nuclear production. SMRs solve a huge issue within the
economics of nuclear energy production since they are cheaper to produce capital-wise and can be
properly tailored to meet the owner’s (or consumer’s) specific demands. New reactors are being designed
to adjust output levels based on demand and reactors that use new types of coolant including molten salt
and liquid metal can be subsidized as well. Only the best and most innovative technologies should be
considered for an ITC and the government should deeply analyze which technologies will benefit society
the most economically and decide from there.
On top of subsidies towards new technologies, the United States could benefit from the government
entering cost-sharing agreements with nuclear construction or start-up projects. Similar to France, this
would spread liability away from the owners who already risk a lot to provide supply. This could be done
34
through the expansion of programs that are already in place, such as the Gateway for Accelerated
Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) from the DOE, which looks to assist start-ups in commercializing their
nuclear technology. Contracts in the form of federal power purchase agreements could be offered through
DOE programs, then auctioned out and awarded to companies that have the best performance in terms of
production and safety, guaranteeing a baseline cash flow for the operating company on any specific
project.
Government market entrance into the utility sector via capital investment or subsidy could increase
revenue for nuclear plants since electricity is currently sold at wholesale prices to utility companies then
distributed to consumers in the U.S. The government could buy electricity at its current market price for
utility purposes then distribute at a loss which is passed onto taxpayers. Another way that avoids
government competition in the private market would be to subsidize nuclear production firms for the
profit which is lost when electricity is sold at wholesale prices to private utility companies. All of these
are great ways to lower the barrier of entry to new firms with lower capital budgets and showcase how
there are multiple ways to drive costs down for those already in the market.
As mentioned earlier, research and development towards safer and more efficient nuclear technology
through non-profits and universities is highly prevalent in the United States. The technology involved in
nuclear energy is highly sensitive to accidents and robust knowledge of the systems which are employed
in construction and production by the operating company are vital towards building a healthy nuclear
market. Investing in R&D allows a deeper understanding of these systems, thus allowing operators to
handle things safely and correctly when accidents occur. While the government needs to continue its
surge of large investments towards R&D in nuclear, other subsidies which address market
competitiveness need to be brought to the table quickly if nuclear wants to remain competitive to natural
gas and renewables.
Comparison Across International Nuclear Markets
France
Overview
Within the French energy economy, nuclear is the dominant energy source by quite some amount. Nuclear
energy within France accounts for the majority of the electricity that is produced. Because of this, France
has become the largest exporter in the world of electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association,
“Over the last decade France has exported up to 70 TWh net each year. In 2018 exports were principally
to Italy, Spain, the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg” (World Nuclear Association, 2021).
Having a clean energy baseload power source which is led by the government has had a significant impact
on France’s energy market and the overall economy, which is showcased by these export numbers.
About 90% of France’s electricity generation comes from low emission sources such as nuclear and
renewables. In terms of developed economies, France should be seen as a leader in how a government-led
energy program mixed with the private market can become independent and reliant on clean energy. This
35
has led France to become one of the better-developed countries in terms of CO2 emissions per capita
(Baude et al., 2020).
Overall, France has been a leader in the world in terms of total share and total production of energy
produced from nuclear, this has been achieved by numerous systems, including how France is one of the
only countries which seeks non-domestic uranium mining development as well as a combination of
private and large public investment (Nuclear Energy Institute, 2021; Nuclear Energy Agency &
International Atomic Energy Agency, 2020). Despite this, French citizens are not all favorable of new
nuclear sites and the United States citizen base is much more excited about the potential of new nuclear
projects (Schneider, 2008)
Construction & Financial Policy
As mentioned above, France’s energy sector is a mix of private and public funding. EDF, the largest
state-run utility and energy provider for nuclear power in France, cooperates and combines with the
public market frequently on projects, leading to clashes between EDF representatives, government
officials, politicians, and other big businesses involved in energy production. Although, in recent times,
France has begun to pump the brakes on new nuclear projects and plans on cutting back its total share of
nuclear energy production down to 50%, which is quite a drastic reduction that you can picture by looking
at Figure 4.1 below (World Nuclear Association, 2021).
In 2014, the French government passed a new policy by the National Assembly and then the Senate titled
the “Energy Transition for Green Growth” bill. Within this bill, we see a shift in strategy for France’s
energy mix that is more reliant on renewable energy and propose the reduction of nuclear capacity as
stated above. Originally, France looked to close enough nuclear plants to hit that 50% benchmark by 2025
but this has been pushed back to 2035 with an update to the national energy policy coming in 2018.
Despite this, the building of new nuclear plants is still considered an option in the bill and seems to be
getting more attention in 2018.
France is likely always going to keep building new plants as an option, due to their high degree of
standardization towards PWR designs. On top of this, nuclear plants in France are rarely discussed
amongst politicians and fall outside the discussion within elections, despite the importance nuclear has to
the country. The issue of nuclear power in France is predominantly decided by a group of industrial
engineers and technocrats who look to push energy policy without the political debates that come along
with it, called the Corps des Mines (Schneider, 2008). This is explained by the fact that the governing
body of the Corps des Mines, the General Mining Council, is controlled by the French Minister of
Industry. The ministry of this body may change, but the corporations who support it will not. Because of
this, France has an edge on long-term construction projects and decision-making with nuclear since
politics are left to the side and the focus is on the stable, long-term policy. This draws a stark contrast to
the United States, where energy policy is dictated by who is currently in power and is more likely to incur
sweeping changes in favor of withholding a democratic system across economic industries.
New construction of nuclear plants in France will only happen if it continues to be economically viable,
which is a difficult parameter to forecast for any project. According to Reuters, who reported on new
36
proposed plants that may be considered for construction by the French government, “French power utility
EDF estimates it would cost at least 46 billion euros ($51 billion) to build six of its latest generation EPR
nuclear reactors if the government decides to build them. Each reactor would cost 7.5 billion to 7.8
billion euros, based on building the reactors in pairs with financing over about 20 years (Thomas, 2019).”
These cost estimates seem about comparable to what a U.S. company would face when constructing a
new plant, although it is difficult to say since there are many variables that go into constructing a new
plant and the subsidization systems are different. Whether or not these new plants will be economically
viable if they are ever put up has to do a lot with these variables. Cost overruns can occur to any
construction site at any time, for a magnitude of reasons. These are rarely planned for since they are
highly unexpected and at times can cause damage to the economic viability of a project. Despite these
occurrences which can happen at any plant, France has many fall back options due to the high degree of
standardization amongst designs and effectiveness of issuing policy
As of right now, France’s future for nuclear energy is highly uncertain. Plant’s are being shut down, that is
for certain, but when and how is still up for debate. Alongside this, the debate rages on for what will
replace that vital clean energy and how it will get accomplished. As of right now, the French government
is calling on itself and the private sector to weigh the laid out options rationally and scientifically. France
looks to continue support for both nuclear and renewables, but to what degree is left to be seen.
Comparison to the United States
Figure 4.1
37
Figure 4.2
As described earlier, within 2019 France’s dependency on nuclear energy as a baseload power source and
significant interest in renewables is clear, while the United States’ dependency on natural gas and coal is
evident based on the distribution of the shares, with the two totaling 62.3% of the graph. It is important to
note that these shares may be slightly off since not all power sources are considered, just ones that we felt
show significant proportions above 0.5%.
With that in mind, when comparing the two charts next to each other, nuclear energy in France holds the
largest overall share of nuclear production, with it clearly being the dominant power source there.
Hydropower generation is also a notable form of production in France, with it taking the largest
proportion of technology considered renewable, opposite of many developed countries who have begun
industrializing wind and solar farms mainly. Most interestingly about France could possibly be what is not
on the graph, as France has ended coal production entirely in recent years (Enerdata, 2021). The United
States has a unique, diverse spread of power sources with natural gas generating the most electricity in
7. The United States is also heavily reliant on fossil fuel energy sources (coal and natural gas). France
on the other hand generates almost 90% of their energy from clean sources (nuclear, hydro, solar PV).
The stark differences between these two countries' energy mixes can be explained by a multitude of
reasons, the main reason boils down to uncertainty. In both situations, the energy crisis and oil shocks of
the 1970s contributed significantly to the make-up of these pie charts (Yale University, n.d.). For France,
nuclear began as a cheaper, more reliable alternative to oil and coal by the late 70’s, which led to
accelerated investment and interest in the technology. The French energy plan, coined as “tout-éléctrique,
tout-nucléaire” or “all-electric, all-nuclear” by French nuclear engineering experts and pitched within the
government following the oil shock of 1973. France sought to build 44 nuclear power plants, with 50,000
38
total installed megawatts with no clear timeframe (Morris, 2015; Røren, 2013), currently France has
61,370 MW of total net capacity installed, compared to the United States 95,523 MW (PRIS.org, 2021).
The French government has been successful in becoming increasingly energy independent by assisting in
the financing of nuclear power plants themselves as opposed to fully relying on the private market.This
has had a huge impact of the economy of France, with WorldData reporting on their energy consumption
page that “France could provide itself completely with self-produced energy. The total production of all
electric energy producing facilities is 529 bn kWh, which is 117% of the country's own usage (WorldData,
n.d.).”
Lessons from France for the United States
In terms of rapidly expanding a reliable nuclear fleet with streamlined regulations and a closed fuel cycle,
France is one of the best in the business. France grew its nuclear production quickly in the 1970s, similar
to the United States, with one major difference being government involvement and the closed off fuel
cycle. France, alongside another nuclear powerhouse, Russia, have regulations where constructors and
operators are usually limited or done by the government themselves, which speeds up the design process
and allows the government to have more control over the supporting industries. Within France, this is
shown off by the fact that nuclear waste is reused for the purpose of energy production so that the least
amount of waste can be produced. This, alongside a government driven market which was discussed
earlier, seems to give France the edge in terms of construction time and therefore cost, which is lower
than the world average for PWRs of the same size (Carajilescov & Moreira, 2011). Alongside this, France
has bolstered uranium mining projects worldwide through investment and oversight, which strengthens
the systems of reprocessing and conversion. For the United States, these are the key takeaways to be
analyzed.
By implementing new systems or reworking old ones, nuclear power can become even more efficient than
it already is in the United States. This is not to be confused with the cost-sharing that happens in France,
where a private business and a governmental body will jointly finance a project, which may be a viable
option in the United States but requires larger hurdles to jump over. On top of that, the United States
system is built upon private intervention to fill demands, so cost-sharing will come at a loss to the
entrepreneurial spirit of America, possibly stunting new innovations which could lead to further
standardization. The United States has a simple licensing regulatory process but a lengthy and expensive
one. By continuing to streamline this process, we will allow for less overruns during construction, which
saves plant operators tons of money.
An easier solution more fitting to the United States current capitalist system would be national
reprocessing labs, which could be government backed or highly incentivized. These would allow for
waste reprocessing for the purpose of energy consumption. The United States has already addressed
uranium supply constraints on energy production and plans to bolster domestic and foregin uranium
mining and conversion. On top of this, the United States could further implement more thorough interest
in uranium deposits and other aspects of the nuclear supply chain worldwide by continuing to up its
uranium reserves to fill supply when foreign markets take a hit. All of these would take significant time
and effort to implement but with France as an example, we see how planning long-term pays off since the
French system leads energy exports worldwide due to its independence and reliance on nuclear energy.
39
Overall, the United States must take these lessons from France to continue the goal of energy
independence and speed up the fastest path to zero.
Japan
Overview
After the Tohoku disaster in March 2011, Japan sharply decreased its use of nuclear power. It instead
pivoted to using more natural gas and coal to fill in the gap in power production. It has slowly started to
add more solar PV into its energy generation mix as well. As shown in Figure 4.3, there was a temporary
shutdown of all nuclear power in Japan around 2012 (CNN, 2013). This was done as a reaction to the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant’s meltdown following the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis. During
this time, maintenance checks and inspections were being done. In 2014, approvals from the Japanese
government and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Agency began to go through and in 2015, some reactors were
coming back on line (Tsukimori et al., 2014).
Figure 4.3
Japan has its emissions target of at least 46% below 2013 levels by 2030 (Birol, 2021). To reach their
target, Japan is planning on having about 20% of their electricity produced by nuclear power (Nikkei Staff
40
Writers, 2021). Regulations put into place after the 2011 disaster state that the normal lifespan of a
nuclear power plant to 40 years with extensions to 60 years being possible.
There are financial support programs for further research and development from the government. Here is
data for the Japanese fiscal year of 2019 taken from METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry) of
Japan:
Table 4.4
There has also been investment into a new nuclear plant as well as the construction of a new reactor. The
new reactor is being put up in the Shimane plant and is an advanced boiling water reactor type (ABWR)
that is a collaboration between GE and Hitachi (International Atomic Energy Agency Power Reactor
Information System, n.d.; GE-Hitachi, n.d.). The companies have designated this a Gen III design and
will output 1350 to 1460MW. This design is rated for 60 years of operation and is supposed to have
fewer parts and pipes compared to PWRs. The product page also claims its modular design that helps
reduce capital and O&M costs as well as a reduction in construction time.
The Ohma nuclear power plant began construction in Ohma-machi, Shimokita-gun, Aomori, Japan in
May 2008 and was supposed to be finished and operational by March 2012 (Power Technology, n.d.).
However, construction was stalled after the earthquake in March 2011. The reactor being used is also an
ABWR. It has a planned output of 1,383MW and according to PRIS (International Atomic Energy
Agency Power Reactor Information System), is expected to start operation in 2021. We were unable to
find the TCC or construction costs of either the Shimane no. 3 reactor or the Ohma facility before the
submission deadline.

For ABWRs, the reactors listed in Table 4.5 show that Japan was able to put up their most modern type of
BWRs in a fairly short amount of time. However, these all finished construction and began commercial
operation well before the massive earthquake in March of 2011. The two ABWRs that are currently being
constructed began in October 2006 and May 2010 for Shimane no. 3 and Ohma, respectively. The
Shimane no. 3 was nearing completion at the time of the quake, but was set back due to an increase in
required safety measures for all nuclear power plants. They are both nearing completion and should begin
commercial operation in the near future. For completely new nuclear projects, it is hard to determine how
much investment there will be. After the Fukushima meltdown, there have been no new nuclear power
plant construction projects in the pipeline. The Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority has been busy
with new safety guidelines and the inspecting and approving of plants restarting after they have been
updated with better safety measures and equipment.
Japan has been steady in how they approach building nuclear power plants (Carajilescov & Moreira,
2011). According to Carajilescov and Moreira, Japan made the process for applying for the permits for
design, construction, and operation of plants seamless with the government agencies working with the
companies that will construct and operate the plants when completed. Because of standardizing and
modularizing plant designs, they have been able to quickly finish the constructing plants and start
commercial operations. In Carajilescov and Moreira’s paper, they peg Japan’s construction time for
nuclear plants to be around 60 months, but with the benefits of learning how to build standardized designs
of nuclear power plants, Japan’s construction companies were able to complete them even quicker.
This should be something that the U.S. considers with its nuclear market. If the approval process for site
designs and licensing are streamlined and the plant designs are standardized, the construction time of
plants can be much shorter. In turn, this will lower the costs associated since less time will be billed to
engineers, managers, and laborers. There will also be an aspect of learning involved as companies take
lessons from previous projects to the next ones and improve subsequent construction projects. The
needed time, resources, and capital required will reduce and fit more comfortably within their initial
plans. For the U.S., this would become a boon because often, new nuclear construction projects are met
with delays and problems that extend the time required. That becomes cost overruns as labor,
professional and manual, have to be involved with the job for longer.
42
Conclusion & Key Points
Within this paper, we overviewed how greenhouse gases are having a negative impact on the environment
thus the need for alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. Unlike any other time in human history,
economic demands may not outweigh social cost to society due to these negative effects. Following that,
we explained why nuclear energy should be the desired energy source to replace fossil fuels but also
described some concerns with nuclear energy regarding production and aging. The analysis consisted of
economic/business metrics such as LCOE and SWOT. Also, we looked at construction costs and
regulations, which play a vital role in the cost of producing electricity. Lastly, we discussed the effects of
carbon capture systems, cap and trade schemes, and decommissioning while also comparing the U.S.
nuclear energy market internationally and looking at how subsidies impact energy production.
Next, nuclear energy can be an important part of moving the electricity generation sector to zero carbon
emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement. It will take the combination of many
innovative policies and ideas, including a more accurate carbon price, subsidies, new technology
proliferation, as well as extending the life of currently operating nuclear power plants will be necessary to
achieve this goal. Also, the public needs to understand what risks are involved with building and
operating a nuclear plant and what the facts are concerning the notable accidents in nuclear’s history.
Due to the sensitivity of data within this particular industry, we felt as if our research was limited by the
data readily available to the public. Had we been able to access the data we wanted regarding the
operations of nuclear plants and its supporting markets we could have created models to try and explain
trends within the overall U.S. nuclear economy.
Currently, the Biden Administration is working on new policy initiatives to improve the electricity
generation industry. They do include budget proposals that will support more research and development
of new nuclear technologies as well as tax credits for new and existing nuclear plants. However, at the
time of writing, it isn’t known how much of the budget would be appropriated for nuclear energy, and
where the funding will actually land once allocated. The large infrastructure bills are currently being
debated in Congress.
We also believe from our research that if the proposed changes to policy and financing are not considered,
large-scale nuclear plants no longer hold a place within the current U.S. energy mix. The nuclear market
in its current state will look to shift away from large-scale, construction-project reactors, towards small
reactors due to the capabilities and technological edge the new reactors have, for a fraction of the cost.
The economics of large reactors simply are not there anymore in the United States and policy on a federal
level needs to adjust before new large plants can go up. An analysis on what the market layout for SMRs
and how they can be properly deployed is relevant to this paper but unfortunately out of our scope. We
hope that more research can come out of our paper with regards to the effects that the shift towards SMRs
will have on the nuclear market and subsequently the entire energy market.

Key Takeaways
● Fossil Fuel production in the United States and worldwide is detrimental to human health and the
environment. Carbon emission is the major metric for judging how we are handling our impact on
global climate change.
● Aging nuclear plants within the United States need license extensions to continue operating as
long as it is determined to be safe to do so.
● Nuclear still has an edge compared to renewable power sources such as solar and wind, in that it's
a proven functional baseload technology. Renewables in recent times have been proven to boast
higher MW facilities than before, although nothing that can rival the top nuclear plants in terms of
load capacity has been built in the United States yet.
● Nuclear plants are still very good sources of zero carbon-emitting electricity. Their continued
operation is also currently much more cost-effective than new nuclear plant construction.
● The Biden Administration must show the world that we can be large innovators for clean energy
production, through the expansion of existing energy programs by increasing federal involvement
in nuclear energy production via subsidies, which take on many different forms.
● Nuclear’s main competition in coal and natural gas must be limited through federal policy via
carbon capture systems. This is because nuclear firms internalize their negative externalities on
their balance sheet, while fossil fuel externalities are passed onto society.
● Carbon capture systems more accurately reflect the cost that is burdened onto society during
fossil fuel production and is an attempt to internalize those costs onto the plant operators, we
believe .
● New nuclear plants can be put up if we continue to learn from the international market and
effectively handle the implementation of new policy for all energy sources. The US can
standardize plant designs and allow plant owners to collaborate with rules and inspections with
the NRC like France and Japan does. This can lead to reductions in construction time of new
nuclear plants and make the construction process more predictable. Furthermore, this can lead to
cost reductions as there will be less waste and less expenditure on labor.
● High carbon prices would make nuclear power more competitive compared to natural gas plants
as long as the discount rate isn’t greater than 7%.
