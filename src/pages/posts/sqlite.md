# SQLite is the best SQL, change my mind.

No need for a heavy installation--just direct interaction with a simple .db file.

SQLite doesn’t even need a GUI to be powerful, though if you prefer one, I recommend DB Browser for SQLite. 

It’s a fantastic tool for visual database management!

Why SQLite stands out for me:

- **Simplicity**: Manage your database with minimal setup.
- **Flexibility**: No need for complex configurations.
- **Efficiency**: Perfect for small to medium-sized projects.

I believe SQLite is useful for all small/medium projects that need a database, but when programming in Go, it becomes a breeze to manage SQL tables. Below is an example of creating a table with SQLite in Go.

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)

func main() {
    // Open a connection to the SQLite database
    db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "./example.db")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening database:", err)
        return
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Create a table with 5 columns
    createTableSQL := `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        age INTEGER,
        email TEXT UNIQUE,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );`

    _, err = db.Exec(createTableSQL)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating table:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Table created successfully!")
}
```

In ~20 lines of code, we’ve created a 5-column table with robust error handling and the ability to pass our tables around as objects. SQLite really shines in its simplicity and power, making it a fantastic choice for Go developers!

### Conclusion

Using Go with SQLite makes managing data a breeze compared to the large overhead of complex database management systems.
